First exercising using both HTML and CSS. 

All layout done using a mix of block level elements and flexbox.

Put into practice flexbox, formatting, selectors and html structure.

Reflection:
Good
    Did not struggle with selectors. Significant step up form practice exercises. Used multiple selectors effectively. Remembered that not every element needs to have a unique class.
    Relatively close copy of the design brief without referencing any other solutions
    Looked up multiple CSS properties to achieve the required look including min and max width/height, border-radius.

Bad
    Had to relearn justify-content and align-items. Was getting confused by the main axis switching on flex-direction: column;
    Struggled to control the size of a large image. Had to study how to use min/max-height/width to get it to work
    Spent a lot fo time struggling getting the cards right before realizing i could use flex:0; and gap:20px; to achieve the desired effect
